Anticipating rapid growth, the city of Engagement, Ohio USA is doing a participatory urban planning exercise to understand the current state of the city and identify oppor-tunities for future growth. About 1000 representative residents in this modest-sized city have agreed to provide data using the city’s urban planning app, which records the places they visit, their spending, and their purchases, among other things. From these volunteers, the city will have data to assist with their major community revi-talization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received. Considering the financial status of Engagement’s businesses and residents, we need to use visual analytic techniques to address the financial health of the city.
