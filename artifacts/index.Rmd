# Introduction
Anticipating rapid growth, the city of Engagement, Ohio USA is doing a participatory urban planning exercise to understand the current state of the city and identify oppor-tunities for future growth. About 1000 representative residents in this modest-sized city have agreed to provide data using the city’s urban planning app, which records the places they visit, their spending, and their purchases, among other things. From these volunteers, the city will have data to assist with their major community revi-talization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received. Considering the financial status of Engagement’s businesses and residents, we need to use visual analytic techniques to address the financial health of the city.

# Proposal
The dataset was acquired from [VAST Challenge 2022](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/). It contains 13 tables of data, containing information about the status of each of the 1,010 participants, information about residential apartments in the city and information about financial transactions, etc. The time period analysed was between 2022 March to 2023 May.

Our project is motivated by providing financial insights for individuals and guidance for fiscal policy making of state Ohio. We will integrate various related data sources and inspect the information provided by participants over time to help answer the following questions: 

  - **Consumption Preference:** Is there any pattern for people’s consumption behavior?  
  - **Business Development:** Which businesses appear to be more prosperous or struggling? 
  - **Financial Health:** How does the financial health of the residents change over time? Are there groups that appear to exhibit similar patterns?
  - **Employer Health:** What employment patterns can be observed within the city limits? Are there any areas of particularly high or low turnover?
