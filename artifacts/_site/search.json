About 1000\r\nrepresentative residents in this modest-sized city have agreed to\r\nprovide data using the city’s urban planning app, which records the\r\nplaces they visit, their spending, and their purchases, among other\r\nthings. From these volunteers, the city will have data to assist with\r\ntheir major community revi-talization efforts, including how to allocate\r\na very large city renewal grant they have recently received. Considering\r\nthe financial status of Engagement’s businesses and residents, we need\r\nto use visual analytic techniques to address the financial health of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nOhio nightview\r\nProposal\r\nThe dataset was acquired from VAST Challenge 2022.\r\nIt contains 13 tables of data, containing information about the status\r\nof each of the 1,010 participants, information about residential\r\napartments in the city and information about financial transactions,\r\netc. The time period analysed was between 2022 March to 2023 May.\r\nOur project is motivated by providing financial insights for\r\nindividuals and guidance for fiscal policy making of state Ohio. We will\r\nintegrate various related data sources and inspect the information\r\nprovided by participants over time to help answer the following\r\nquestions:\r\nConsumption Preference: Is there any pattern for\r\npeople’s consumption behavior?\r\nBusiness Development: Which businesses appear to be\r\nmore prosperous or struggling?\r\nFinancial Health: How does the financial health of\r\nthe residents change over time? Are there groups that appear to exhibit\r\nsimilar patterns?\r\nEmployer Health: What employment patterns can be\r\nobserved within the city limits? Are there any areas of particularly\r\nhigh or low turnover?\r\nIf you want to view a more detailed storyboard of our proposal,\r\nplease click here!\r\nRSHINY APP\r\nIf embedded RShiny app does not work as intended, do visit here to view the\r\napp directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoster\r\nYou may view our poster below or here!\r\n\r\nOur Poster\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
